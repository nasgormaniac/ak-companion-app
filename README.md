### This is a companion app for playing Animal Kaiser or Animal Kaiser Evolution using Play! emulator

This app replaces scanner in the arcade machine, so you can use your card for playing the game

- Send card barcode data to the emulator via I/O Http server.

- Automatically redirecting from each card page when you use card from the catalogue. Enables using card quickly.

## Soon... :hammer_and_wrench:
1. Add filtration.
2. Add card set. Add 3 card(animal, strong, miracle) to a set so you can use it in one click. With info of set rank(bronze, silver, gold).
3. Add recommendation for a card set.
4. User account available for managing card set.

## Need to Fix :warning:
- Make items into components
- Fix input error, not showing error hint
- Fix succes hint not showing
- Fix failed hint not showing
- Add validation in form and controller for card code, valid code starts with "bn"
- Fix excess 'mr' in card form
